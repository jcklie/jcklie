### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student on the INCEpTION project where I am working on interactive annotation for NLP. Currently I research how several annotation tasks, e.g. creating corpora with linked entities or predicate-argument structures can be supported by interactive machine learning. In my free time, I love to learn Mandarin.

Please see my [personal blog](mrklie.com) for more information.
