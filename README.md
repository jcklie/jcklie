### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I am a Machine Learning and Software Engineer. Recently, I finished  my Ph.D. studying Natural Language Processing at the [UKP Lab in Darmstadt, Germany](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp).
I have a strong background in **data annotation** including best practices, increasing annotation efficiency and quality, **software backend engineering** as well as building **AI IT infrastructure**.
If that sounds interesting, then I would be happy hearing from you!
