### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate studying Natural Language Processing at the [UKP Lab in Darmstadt, Germany](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp). In addition to my current [research](https://www.mrklie.com/), I am also available as an AI consultant. 
I have a strong background in **data annotation** including best practices, increasing annotation efficiency and quality, **software backend engineering** as well as building **AI IT infrastructure**.
If that sounds interesting, then I would be happy hearing from you! 

Please see my [website](https://klie-ai.de) and  [personal blog](https://mrklie.com) for more information.
