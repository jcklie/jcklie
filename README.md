### Hi there 👋
I am a PhD student on the [INCEpTION project](https://inception-project.github.io/) where I am working on interactive annotation for NLP. Currently I research how several annotation tasks, e.g. creating corpora with linked entities or predicate-argument structures can be supported by interactive machine learning. In my free time, I love to learn Mandarin. My Chinese name is 杨洋.

Please see my [personal blog](https://mrklie.com) for more information.
